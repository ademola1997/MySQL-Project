SELECT *
FROM layoffs;


-- First, let's create a staging table to clean the data while preserving the raw data as a backup
CREATE TABLE layoffs_staging
LIKE layoffs;

INSERT layoffs_staging
SELECT *
FROM layoffs;





-- During data cleaning, we generally follow a series of steps.
-- 1. Remove Duplicates
-- 2. Standardize the Data
-- 3. Null Values or blank value
-- 4. Remove Any Columns


-- 1. Remove Duplicates
# let's start by checking for duplicates.

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging;

SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;


SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, industry, total_laid_off,`date`
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
) duplicates
WHERE 
	row_num > 1;

-- let's just look at oda to confirm
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
WHERE company = 'Oda';

-- These appear to be legitimate entries and shouldn't be deleted. We'll need to carefully review each row for accuracy.

-- This query finds the real duplicates. We need to partition by all the columns in the dataset.

SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
) duplicates
WHERE 
	row_num > 1;

-- We want to delete rows where the row number is greater than 1

-- Now, you may want to write a query like this:

WITH DELETE_CTE AS 
(
SELECT *
FROM (
	SELECT company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
) duplicates
WHERE 
	row_num > 1
)
DELETE
FROM DELETE_CTE
;

-- We run into an issue. A good solution is to create a new column for row numbers, delete rows where the number is greater than 1, and then drop the column.
-- Letâ€™s do it!

ALTER TABLE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging ADD row_num INT;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
;

-- let's create another table
CREATE TABLE `world_layoffs`.`layoffs_staging2` (
`company` text,
`location`text,
`industry`text,
`total_laid_off` INT,
`percentage_laid_off` text,
`date` text,
`stage`text,
`country` text,
`funds_raised_millions` int,
row_num INT
);

INSERT INTO `world_layoffs`.`layoffs_staging2`
(`company`,
`location`,
`industry`,
`total_laid_off`,
`percentage_laid_off`,
`date`,
`stage`,
`country`,
`funds_raised_millions`,
`row_num`)
SELECT `company`,
`location`,
`industry`,
`total_laid_off`,
`percentage_laid_off`,
`date`,
`stage`,
`country`,
`funds_raised_millions`,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
			PARTITION BY company, location, industry, total_laid_off,percentage_laid_off,`date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions
			) AS row_num
	FROM 
		world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;

-- Now that we have this, we can delete rows where row_num is 2 or greater

DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE row_num >= 2;



-- 2. Standardize Data

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- if we look at industry it looks like we have some null and empty rows, let's take a look at these
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- let's take a look at these
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'Bally%';
-- nothing wrong here
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE company LIKE 'airbnb%';

-- it looks like airbnb is a travel, but this one just isn't populated
-- I'm sure the same applies to the others. What we can do is...
-- What we can do is write a query that, if another row with the same company name exists, will update it with the non-null industry values
-- This makes it easier, so if there are thousands of rows, we won't have to manually check each one

-- We should set the blanks to nulls, as they are typically easier to work with
UPDATE world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
SET industry = NULL
WHERE industry = '';

-- now if we check those are all null

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

-- Next, we need to populate those nulls, if possible

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 t1
JOIN layoffs_staging2 t2
ON t1.company = t2.company
SET t1.industry = t2.industry
WHERE t1.industry IS NULL
AND t2.industry IS NOT NULL;

-- and if we check it looks like Bally's was the only one without a populated row to populate this null values
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE industry IS NULL 
OR industry = ''
ORDER BY industry;

--------------------------------------
-- I also noticed that 'Crypto' has several variations. We should standardize them to 'Crypto
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET industry = 'Crypto'
WHERE industry IN ('Crypto Currency', 'CryptoCurrency');

-- now that's taken care of:
SELECT DISTINCT industry
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY industry;

-- --------------------------------------------------
-- we also need to look at 

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- Everything looks good, except we have some entries as 'United States' and others as 'United States.' with a period at the end. Let's standardize them.
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;

UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET country = TRIM(TRAILING '.' FROM country);

-- Now, if we run this again, it should be fixed
SELECT DISTINCT country
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
ORDER BY country;


-- Let's also fix the date columns:
SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- we can use str to date to update this field
UPDATE layoffs_staging2
SET `date` = STR_TO_DATE(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

-- now we can convert the data type properly
ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
MODIFY COLUMN `date` DATE;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;




-- 3. Look at Null Values

-- The null values in total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, and funds_raised_millions all look normal. I don't think we need to change those
-- I prefer keeping them as null because it makes calculations easier during the EDA phase

-- We should leave them as null because it simplifies calculations during the EDA phase.



-- 4. remove any columns and rows we need to

SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL;


SELECT *
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

-- Delete Useless data we can't really use
DELETE FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

ALTER TABLE layoffs_staging2
DROP COLUMN row_num;


SELECT * 
FROM world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;
